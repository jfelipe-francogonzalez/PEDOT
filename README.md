# About PEDOT
Among all conducting polymers, PEDOT or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) has a special place within the field of organic electronics due to its outstanding conductivity, stability, and processability. Since PEDOT was first synthesized in the late 1980s, a massive amount of knowledge has been accumulated about its morphological, structural and electrical properties, along with its applications in several fields. Notably, however, is that the vast majority of the reports in the field are purely experimental, without much theoretical support from simulation and modeling. The lack of the theoretical understanding of many important aspects of the material properties and device functionality leads to misconceptions and controversial concepts. 

## About this Repository
The purpose of this Repository is to fill the technical computational knowledge gap for creating a PEDOT model. It is based on my own original contributin to the field.

#### Initial goal
I am starting to upload my original contribution to PEDOT's molecular models
